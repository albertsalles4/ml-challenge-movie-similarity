# ML Challenge – Movie Similarity Model

This is a challenge to compare text embeddings. The tasks are the following:
1. Research and align on the best similarity approach.
2. Design and deploy a modular and scalable infrastructure for the model.
3. Build and showcase a demo of the solution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
python -m venv venv # Optional: create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

The main file contains an example of how to use the code. It loads the data and runs the winner models for each pair
with available data.

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```
